# Portfolio with React + Vite

This is a simple portfolio created with React, Javascript and Vite where it shows all the projects that I developed. The styles are built with CSS.

It is using some libraries to improve the UX like:

    - [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com): For form validation.
    - [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com): For showing toast messages once a message is sent.
    - ([EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)): For sending emails.
